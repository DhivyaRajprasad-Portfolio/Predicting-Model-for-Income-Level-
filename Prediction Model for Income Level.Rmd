#Description of the Dataset
The dataset used is US Census data which is an extraction of the 1994 census data which was donated to the UC Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository.                             
The data contains approximately 32,000 observations with over 15 variables.              
The dataset was downloaded from:                
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult.            
The dependent variable in our analysis will be income level and who earns above $50,000 a year using SQL queries, Proportion Analysis using bar charts and Simple Decision Tree to understand the important variables and their influence on prediction.    

#R Packages Used

#Importing the dataset
```{r}
data <- read.csv("adult.csv", header=FALSE, sep= ",", strip.white=TRUE,col.names= c("age", "workclass", "fnlwgt", "education", "educationnum", "maritalstatus", "occupation","relationship", "race", "sex", "capitalgain",
 "capitalloss", "hoursperweek", "nativecountry",
"incomelevel"), na.strings= "?", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
kable(head(data))
```

#Description of the variables in the dataset            
The variables and their classifications are as given below:      
```{r, results= 'asis'}
variabletable<- read.csv("Workbook1.csv")
kable(variabletable)
```

#Basic commands to know about the Data     

##Summary of the data
```{r, comment=NA, message=NA}
kable(summary(data))
```

##Description of the dataset
```{r, comment=NA, message=NA}
describe(data)
```

#Normalization of the data
The dataset is already normalized as there are no repetitive data which can be used to split into multiple tables and there isn’t data redundancy or data integrity improvements available for this particular dataset. 


#Problems in the Data

##Recoded Missing Values
We recoded the data with NA for the string "?" (Which denotes misisng value in the dataset) when we imported the file to make the treatment of missing values easier.

##Missing Data
2399 datapoints are found to be missing which is 7.3% of the dataset.
```{r, comment=NA, message=NA}
table(complete.cases(data)) 
```

We find that about 2066 of the missing observations centres around <=50 k category and since most of the data has <=50 k category as the income level, removing these missing variables will not affect the data integrity.
```{r,comment=NA, message=NA}
summary(data[!complete.cases(data),])
```

Removing the missing data
```{r, comment=NA, message=NA}
data <- na.omit(data)
```

##Unncessary Variables
The fnlwgt which is the final weight determined by the Census Organization is of no use in any of the analysis that we are doing henceforth and is removed. The educationnum if a repetitive variable which recodes the categorical variable education as a numeric variable but will be used in the analysis for decision trees, hence is not being removed.

```{r, comment=NA, message=NA}
Finaldata <- sqldf("SELECT age
                           ,workclass
                    ,education
                    ,educationnum
                    ,maritalstatus
                    ,occupation
                    ,relationship
                    ,race
                    ,sex
                    ,capitalgain
                    ,capitalloss
                    ,hoursperweek
                    ,nativecountry
                    ,incomelevel
                    FROM data
                    ")
kable(head(Finaldata))
```

##Recoding Income Levels
The values for the income levels are recoded with 1 and 0 with >50 k being coded as 1. The sum of the values in this column will hence give the number of people with income >50 k and thus can be an effective prediction tool.
```{r, comment=NA, message=NA}
Finaldata$income<-ifelse(Finaldata$income=='>50K',1,0)
kable(head(Finaldata))
```

#SQL Queries and Exploratory Analysis using R

##Statistics of other variables based on workclass and SQL Queries    
Sample statistics are generated classifying the data by Work Class and calculating the numerical values categorized by the Work Class using GROUPBY, SUM and AVERAGE functions in SQLDF package in R.

```{r, comment=NA, message=NA}
WorkclassClassification <- sqldf("SELECT 
                          workclass,
                          count(*) as Numberofrecords,
                         Avg(age) as averageage,
                         Sum(capitalgain) as capitalgain,
                        Sum(capitalloss) as capitalloss,
                        Avg(hoursperweek),
                        sum(income) as above50k
                         FROM Finaldata
                         GROUP by workclass")
kable(WorkclassClassification)
```

##Statistics based on race

Sample statistics are also generated by classifying the data by Race and calculating the numerical values categorized by the Work Class using GROUPBY, SUM and AVERAGE functions in SQLDF package in R.

```{r, comment=NA, message=NA}
RacesClassification <- sqldf("SELECT 
                                 race,
                                 count(*) as Numberofrecords,
                                 Avg(age) as averageage,
                                 Sum(capitalgain) as capitalgain,
                                 Sum(capitalloss) as capitalloss,
                                 Avg(hoursperweek),
                                 sum(income) as above50k
                                 FROM Finaldata
                                 GROUP by race")
kable(RacesClassification)
```

SQL Queries can also be used to find some basic prediction about the income level and the various categorical variables which contribute towards it.

##Marital Status and implication on the income levels   

We find that Married with Civilian Spouse to have higher amount of people with above 50k income.
We then find the proportions of the people with above 50 k income with respect to the total number of people in each category and find that Married with Armed Forces have a better proportion of people with income above 50k.

```{r, comment=NA, message=NA}
MaritalLevel<- sqldf("SELECT 
                    maritalstatus as status
                    , Count (*) as Count
                    , sum(income) as Above50k
                    FROM 
                    Finaldata
                    GROUP BY 
                    status
                    ORDER BY status") 
kable(MaritalLevel)
Maritalclass<-melt(MaritalLevel,id.vars = 'status')
ggplot(Maritalclass,aes(x=status,y=value,fill=variable))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+
  ggtitle('Proportion of People with income above 50k')+
  xlab("Gender Class")+
  ylab("Number of People")
table<-data.frame(Class=MaritalLevel$status, 
                   Proportion=
                     MaritalLevel$Above50k/MaritalLevel$Count)
kable(table)
```

##Gender and implication on the income levels

We use a similar analysis as above across the Gender Variable and find that Males have a better proportion of people with salaries above 50k and more number of people who have salaries greater than 50k thus raising the spark for gender inequality.

```{r, comment=NA, message=NA}
GenderLevel<- sqldf("SELECT 
                    sex as gender
                       , Count (*) as Count
                       , sum(income) as Above50k
                       FROM 
                       Finaldata
                       GROUP BY 
                       gender
                       ORDER BY gender") 
Genderclass<-melt(GenderLevel,id.vars = 'gender')
ggplot(Genderclass,aes(x=gender,y=value,fill=variable))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+
  ggtitle('Proportion of People with income above 50k')+
  xlab("Gender Class")+
  ylab("Number of People")
table<-data.frame(Class=GenderLevel$gender, 
                   Proportion=
                    GenderLevel$Above50k/GenderLevel$Count)
kable(table)
```


##Work Class and implication on the income levels

We find that the people employed in private companies have more people with income above 50k and Self Employed people having a higher proportion of peoplw with income greater than 50k.

```{r, comment=NA, message=NA}
WorkclassLevel<- sqldf("SELECT 
                    workclass as workclass
                    , Count (*) as Count
                    , sum(income) as Above50k
                    FROM 
                    Finaldata
                    GROUP BY 
                    workclass
                    ORDER BY workclass") 
Workclass<-melt(WorkclassLevel,id.vars = 'workclass')
ggplot(Workclass,aes(x=workclass,y=value,fill=variable))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+
  ggtitle('Proportion of People with income above 50k')+
  xlab("Work Class")+
  ylab("Number of People")
table<-data.frame(Class=WorkclassLevel$workclass, 
                  Proportion=
                    WorkclassLevel$Above50k/WorkclassLevel$Count)
kable(table)
```

##Education Level and implication on the income levels

We find that the Bachelors’ Degree has higher number of people with income above 50 k and Prof School Graduates and Doctorates have higher proportion of people with income about 50k.

```{r, comment=NA, message=NA}
Education_Level<- sqldf("SELECT 
                       education as 'Education'
                       , Count (*) as 'Count'
                       , sum(income) as 'Above50k'
                       FROM 
                       Finaldata
                       GROUP BY 
                       Education
                       ORDER BY Education") 
EducationLevel<-melt(Education_Level,id.vars = 'Education')
ggplot(EducationLevel,aes(x=Education,y=value,fill=variable))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
  ggtitle('Proportion of People with income above 50k')+
  xlab("Education Class")+
  ylab("Number of People")
table<-data.frame(Class=Education_Level$Education, 
                   Proportion=
                     Education_Level$Above50k/Education_Level$Count)
kable(table)
```

#Using R for Statistical Analysis
We use R to create Decision Trees to predict the income levels using all the variables in the dataset.             

##Methodology Used          
Classification methodology was used for this particular data as the response variable income was a binary variable.            

##Advantages of using Decision Trees for this Analysis      
**Simplicity of Interpretation**: The entire data is represented in a visual format which enables us to understand the data quickly and make a prediction.                       
**Ability to use both numeric and categorical variables as predictors**: Our data is a mix of categorical and numeric variables and other commonly used methods such as linear or logistic regressions can use either of these categories but not both in a single algorithm.            

##Algorithm behind             
The package used to construct the tree here is Rpart which uses recursive partitioning of the data with the default criterion being used for each split being Gini Coefficient.  

##Variables used                
We create the tree using all the variables and rank the variables in terms of importance to figure out the variables used by the decision tree algorithm to predict the income.          
```{r,comment=NA, message=NA}
tree <- rpart(incomelevel ~ .,
              data = data,
              method = "class")
imp <- varImp(tree)
rownames(imp)[order(imp$Overall, decreasing=TRUE)]
```
We find that Capital Gain is one of the key predictors followed by education for the income levels.                 
The tree logic is as below where only “capital gain, education and relationship” are used as variables by the tree as Education num and education both have the same data.               
```{r, comment=NA, message=NA}
printcp(tree)
plotcp(tree)
rpart.plot(tree, main = "Basic Classification Tree for Census Data")
```

#Inferences

About 46% of the people are in a relationship called “Husband” or “Wife” which is then further classified based on Education Level where nearly 14% who earn above $50 K have the education of Bachelors, Prof-school, Masters and Doctorate.

The other education levels have income predominantly below $50 k with just 2% having salaries above $50k who also have capital gains greater than $5096

With respect to other relationships, only 1% have income above $50 k and with capital gains greater than $7074.

# Tableau for Visualization

We use 4 sheets to visualize different relationships and use Work Class as the common parameter which will filter the entire dashboard.                  

The first sheet shows the relationship of Education and Number of People Earning > 50 k and separated by Work Class. We find that Bachelors graduates working in Private companies have a higher number of people earning above 50 k.                  

![Impact of Education on Income Levels](Image1.png)

The second sheet shows the relationship of Average hours per week with respect to gender and separated by Work Class and we find that Males typically work more hours per week on Average across all work classes.

![Impact of Gender on Income Levels](Image2.png)

The third sheet shows that the relationship of marital status and income levels separated by Work Class. Majority of the people in Married with Civilian spouse have an income greater than 50 k and majorly in the private sector.

![Impact of Marital Status on Income Levels](Image3.png)


The fourth work sheet shows the impact of occupation, capital gain and capital loss on the income levels which has details of work class too. This is a comprehensive visualization across 4 different parameters. We find that Executives at Managerial Level have more people with income greater than 50 k and Professional Speciality has more capital gains.

#Challenges Faced

1.	The datafile was initially scraped from a web repository called UCI Machine Learning- part of UC Irvine, which crashed in the last two days left for submission and hence R was unable to establish a connection to the data. So, I figured out the FTP page of the website and downloaded the data and uploaded from the hard disk directly for the project. This is not the ideal way but R markdown supports this by establishing a static html page which will provide all the outputs from the commands at the time of publishing the report.                           
2.	Problems with decision trees and R packages- The packages used for prettier decision tree modeling was not working in the R studio and has to be fixed with multiple supporting libraries before proceeding.                                     
3.	Learning SQL DF- R and SQL both are relatively new for me and it took me a while to understand the workings of SQL DF commands.
